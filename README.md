## About The Project

This project serves as a comprehensive operational management system for Decolores Merchandise Stores. It provides a centralized platform for key business tasks, enhancing efficiency, data management, and user experience across different store branches.

Built with the Flask framework, the application follows a modular design using blueprints for authentication, core views, and APIs. It is designed as a **Progressive Web App (PWA)**, offering offline capabilities, background sync, push notifications, and a native-like app experience.
