## About The Project

This project serves as a comprehensive operational management system for Decolores Merchandise Stores. It provides a centralized platform for key business tasks, enhancing efficiency, data management, and user experience across different store branches.

Built with the Flask framework, the application follows a modular design using blueprints for authentication, core views, and APIs. It is designed to be a Progressive Web App (PWA), offering offline capabilities and a native-like app experience.

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Environment Setup

1.  **Create a `.env` file** in the root directory of the project (the same level as `main.py`).

2.  **Copy the contents** of `.env.example` into your new `.env` file.

3.  **Fill in the required values** in your `.env` file:
    *   `FLASK_SECRET_KEY` and `JWT_SECRET_KEY`: Generate strong, random keys.
    *   `MONGO_URI`: Your full MongoDB connection string.
    *   `MAIL_USERNAME` and `MAIL_PASSWORD`: Your Gmail address and the **16-digit App Password** you generated.
    *   `VAPID_` keys: Generate these once for your PWA push notifications.
